## What's this
Portal is a backdoor malware created in C for windows platform, with some features to enable the attacker troll and hack the possible victim computer. This is a more project created inspired by the mobile game Hackers : join the cyberwar. Another project inspired by this game is the Battering ram, that's the link: https://github.com/Romulo-Moraes/Battering-ram

## How its work
This program has a client (the malware) and the server (that will command the client), the client made in C and server made in Python. A Tcp connection will be maked between both, trading messages to make the Portal playground.

## Server dependency
The Portal program is not completly dependent of the server made in Python, you can just bind your server with a netcat, but some features like: Upload file and Write file will not be possible to do, but it's a Tcp conversation at all.
